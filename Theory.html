									<p>The quantum concept of superposition allows for the existence of multiple states simultaneously, until a measurement or observation forces the system into one of the possible states. This is often illustrated by the famous example of Schr√∂dinger's cat, which is both alive and dead until observed.
									</p>
									<p>Now, apply this concept to toys in Toy Story. When not observed by humans, toys exist in a superposition of toy state and sentient being state. This means they are fully aware of their surroundings, can move and talk amongst themselves, and lead a secret life.
									</p>
									<p>However, when humans are present, they're observed and interacted with in their toy state. They remain still and appear inanimate, following the illusion of a typical toy. This ensures they don't arouse suspicion or break the illusion of being mere playthings.
									</p>
									<p>But when humans aren't around, they revert back to their sentient state and carry on with their daily lives. This state of existence, hidden from humans, allows them to form their own society, develop relationships, and have adventures.
									</p>
									<p>In this hypothetical world, toys would be conscious beings living in their own reality, parallel to that of humans. Their sense of time might be different, allowing them to experience entire days or weeks in a matter of hours from the human perspective. This would explain how toys in the Toy Story world could have complex lives and relationships despite only "coming alive" when humans aren't around.
